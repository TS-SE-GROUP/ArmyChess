# ArmyChess
We are trying to realize an armychess game via LAN. Our language is Java and if you have any quetions about how to use this program,
please refer to the Introductions in ./doc.
We are also interested in building an AI for four-country armychess games and now we have built a simple AI just for two countries 
and the chess is visiable. If you have any questions or want to join us, please emails us at aclowpassfilter@gmail.com .
